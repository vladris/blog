<h1>Data Engineering on Azure RTM</h1>

<p>My book, <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/data-engineering-on-azure">Data Engineering on
Azure</a>, which I
announced in <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2020/10/08/azure-data-engineering.html">this blog
post</a>,
is going to print soon. As I did with my previous book, <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2019/10/16/programming-with-types-rtm.html">Programming
with
Types</a>,
I&#39;m writing another <q>RTM</q> post to talk about a few aspects of the
process.</p>

<h2>Title evolution</h2>

<p>When I pitched the book to Manning, I used the title <em>Production Data
Engineering with Azure</em>. The title was supposed to capture that this is
a book about the practical aspects of data engineering, with examples on
the Azure platform. In fact, here is how I described the book&#39;s topic
in the proposal:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The same way Software Engineering brings engineering rigor to software
development, Data Engineering aims to bring rigor to working with data
in a reliable way.</p>

<p>This book is about implementing the various aspects of a big data
platform - data ingestion, running analytics and ML, distributing
data - in a real-world production system. The focus is on operational
aspects like DevOps, monitoring, scale, and compliance. Examples will
be provided using Azure services.</p>

<p>There is a big gap between what it takes, for example, to implement an
ML model in Python and what it takes to run in a production
environment, on a regular basis, with robust guardrails in place. The
book focuses on the latter, which makes it different than other data
platform books.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Manning team has a lot of experience putting together books (and
selling them). We iterated on the title quite a few times, trying to
best capture the essence of the book. Once we started the project, we
changed the name from <em>Production Data Engineering with Azure</em> to
<em>Practical Data Engineering on Azure</em>.</p>

<p>Before launching the book as a Manning Early Access Preview (MEAP), we
changed the name again, this time to <em>Azure Data Engineering</em>: the
<q>Practical</q> part of the title made it a bit too long and not very
clear.</p>

<p>As the manuscript was wrapping up, we took another look at the title:
<em>Azure Data Engineering</em> implies the book is Azure-specific. While all
the examples provided are built in the Azure cloud, my hope is the
patterns and ideas discussed apply to any big data platform, in any
cloud. We iterated on the title again, to emphasize the <q>data
engineering</q> part, and ended up with <em>Data Engineering on Azure</em>. This
is the final title of the book.</p>

<h2>Articles and excerpts</h2>

<p>Before starting the project, I wrote a few articles on the topic. The
first one was <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2019/12/08/notes-on-data-engineering.html">Notes on Data
Engineering</a>.
Soon after, my team launched the <a href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft">Data Science @
Microsoft</a> Medium
publication, where I contributed several articles:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/how-we-built-self-serve-data-environment-tools-with-azure-3951a698fc9d">How we built self-serve data environment tools with
Azure</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/azure-data-explorer-at-the-azure-business-scale-89262ef8c1fd">Azure Data Explorer at the Azure business
scale</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/running-machine-learning-at-scale-808b90f0ec75">Running machine learning at
scale</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/common-data-engineering-challenges-and-their-solution-dd51872812ac">Common data engineering challenges and their
solution</a> -
which is a retake on that first article (Notes on Data Engineering).</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/partnering-for-data-quality-dc9123557f8b">Partnering for data
quality</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/partnering-for-metadata-management-277733911d03">Partnering for metadata
management</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/data-distribution-9085b4316591">Data
distribution</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the ideas from these articles show up in the book. While the
articles talk about the specific challenges my team encountered and the
solutions we came up with to solve them, the book covers patterns - the
general types of problems you would encounter while building a big data
platform, and solutions you could apply. The articles helped me to
clarify (for myself) the topics I wanted to cover in the book, and
refine the proposed solutions.</p>

<p>Once the manuscript was well underway, I wrote a blog post on <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2020/11/13/data-quality-testing-patterns.html">Data
Quality Testing
Patterns</a>
to clarify my thoughts as I was working on chapter 9 (Data quality), but
otherwise switched my focus from articles to getting the book done. At
this point, I started publishing excerpts from the book. So far I wrote
about <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2020/11/27/changing-data-classification-through-processing.html">Changing data classification through
processing</a>
and <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2021/03/12/ingesting-data.html">Ingesting
data</a>, with
more to come.</p>

<h2>The speed of the cloud</h2>

<p>Innovation in cloud computing moves at a break-neck speed. The
technology changes so fast, it is hard to pin things down in written
form. For setting up various Azure services, I wanted to rely on command
line scripts instead of the Azure Portal UI - walking readers through
series of screenshots is tedious, and UI changes all the time. I used
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/">Azure CLI</a> instead. That
said, many of the extensions I used throughout the book are currently
<q>experimental</q>, which means they might change at a future time. I also
found a couple of bugs I reported to the teams maintaining the Azure CLI
extensions.</p>

<p>Another example of the speed of innovation is <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/purview/">Azure
Purview</a>. When I
started working on our data platform, there was no Azure Purview and my
team had to develop a home-grown solution to address our data inventory
needs. We then got to use a preview, in-development version of Azure
Purview before it was publicly announced (one of the perks of working at
Microsoft). Chapter 8 of my book covers metadata management, with the
reference implementation on Azure Purview. That meant I wasn&#39;t able to
start on this chapter until Azure Purview was officially announced, even
though I knew what I wanted to write about. Things lined up pretty well,
I finished chapter 7 and had to skip to chapter 9, but as I was working
on that, Azure Purview went into public preview.</p>

<p>This was a very interesting experience, very different than my previous
book. Writing my first book, I didn&#39;t feel like there were so many
moving parts to get a handle on and the speed with which things changed
wasn&#39;t overwhelming. Even so, I&#39;m confident the patterns I cover in
the book will remain the same for quite some time, regardless of the
technologies used to implement them. So even as new services launch and
the ways we interact with the cloud evolve, the key takeaways should
stay relevant.</p>
