<h1>Azure Data Explorer</h1>

<p>This is a cross-post of the article I wrote for Data Science @
Microsoft, <a href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/azure-data-explorer-at-the-azure-business-scale-89262ef8c1fd">Azure Data Explorer at the Azure business
scale</a>.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in my previous post, <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2020/02/01/self-serve-analytics.html"><q>Self-Serve
Analytics</q></a>,
our team uses Azure Data Explorer (ADX) as our main data store. In this
post, I will delve deeply into how we use ADX.</p>

<h2>Use Case</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer">ADX
documentation</a>
describes it as <q>a fast, fully managed data analytics service for
real-time analysis on large volumes of data streaming from applications,
websites, IoT devices, and more.</q> ADX streams terabytes of data and
enables real-time analytics to be performed on it. In many cases, this
ADX-enabled data is used in the context of ingesting and analyzing
telemetry from various services or endpoints. Our use case for ADX is
different: We use it as the main data store for our big data platform.</p>

<p>We rely on the ingestion capabilities of ADX to pull in terabytes of
data pertaining to the Azure business from various sources. Our data
science team then leverages the fast query capabilities offered by ADX
to explore the data in real time and perform modeling work, which leads
to a better understanding of our customers.</p>

<p>Some of the data points our team uses are already stored in ADX when we
access them, in different clusters managed by other teams. We use the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/query/cross-cluster-or-database-queries?pivots=azuredataexplorer">cross-cluster query
capabilities</a>
provided by ADX to join these external data sets with local data.</p>

<p>Our engineering team also relies on the same fast query capabilities of
ADX to power some of our web APIs.</p>

<h2>Ingestion</h2>

<p>We have a well-defined process to bring new data sets into our cluster.
First, we take a one-time snapshot of a potential data set and store it
in a separate cluster (our <em>acquisition</em> cluster), where access is even
further restricted to the small set of individuals tasked with exploring
this new data set. This initial exploration gives us a good sense of
which parts of the data are useful for ingesting on a regular cadence,
and what our data model should look like. We can then create a data
contract with the upstream team to define SLAs and start automating the
data pull.</p>

<p>All data movement is set up in <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-factory/">Azure Data
Factory</a> and
actively monitored.</p>

<h2>DevOps and Analytics</h2>

<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2020/02/01/self-serve-analytics.html">previous
post</a> on
our data environment, we use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/devops">Azure DevOps ADX
Task</a> to
deploy objects from git. Tables are set up using a
<code>.create-or-merge table</code> script while functions are set up using a
<code>.create-or-alter function</code> script. Both commands are idempotent so we
can replay them even if objects already exist.</p>

<p>As a team, we&#39;ve standardized on ADX functions for analytics, so all
the reports, KPIs, and metrics our team produces end up implemented as
functions stored in git and deployed using Azure DevOps. The ability to
organize objects in a folder structure helps us group them by focus
area.</p>

<h2>Customer Model</h2>

<p>Not only do we ingest large amounts of data into our main ADX cluster,
we are also processing and enhancing it to build what we call the
<em>customer model</em>.</p>

<p>The customer model consists of three components:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <em>keyring</em>, which helps us tie together various identifiers used
across the business, enabling us to understand, for example, which
company a subscription belongs to.</li>
<li>A set of <em>customer properties</em>, which you can think of as key-value
pairs attached to an identity in our system.</li>
<li>An <em>activity model</em>, which represents a timeline view of various
relevant events for an identity in our system. For example, for a
subscription identifier we have events such as <q>created</q> and
<q>closed</q>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="customer-model.png" alt="image"></p>

<p><em>We use a set of Logic Apps and CosmosDB to process and enhance raw data
into our customer model, which consists of a keyring, customer
properties, and an activity model.</em></p>

<p>The customer model is continuously updated as we ingest new data points
and represents an enhanced view of the raw data. It is implemented as a
small set of (very large) tables and multiple functions to improve
navigation. The expressive ADX function syntax allows us to create
functions that can be combined to produce very complex queries of the
data model.</p>

<p>The workflow of building the model is orchestrated by <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/logic-apps/">Logic
Apps</a>, which run
ADX functions to join and enhance the raw data. The keyring is an
exception: We build it using
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction">CosmosDB</a>,
namely the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/graph-introduction">Gremlin
API</a>,
which can perform graph traversal. We load all identifiers as vertices
and known connections as edges, and then we group each connected
component of the graph into a key group. This gives us the association
across all identities within our system. The output is written back to
ADX.</p>

<p>We consume the customer model through ADX functions. As an example, the
<code>GetRelatedKeysByType()</code> function takes as arguments an identifier value
and an identifier type name and returns all identifiers related to it
from the keyring. We can pass the result of this call to the
<code>GetActivities()</code> function, which also takes as arguments a <code>startDate</code>
datetime and an <code>endDate</code> datetime, to get all activities for the given
ID group within that time range.</p>

<p>Different activities are described by different properties. For example,
a <em>subscription created</em> activity contains, among other things, an Offer
ID, an Offer Type, and a flag indicating whether the subscription was
created as a trial. As another example, a <em>daily usage</em> activity
contains the name of the sold service and consumption units. We use the
ADX
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/query/packfunction">pack()</a>
function to store these properties as dynamic objects in the underlying
data model, allowing us to maintain a standard schema.</p>

<h2>Compliance</h2>

<p>Because we store some high business impact data sets, such billing data
for Azure services, we must govern who can see different parts of the
data. We set role-base access control (RBAC) at the database level, so
we can place sensitive data sets in dedicated databases.</p>

<p>We can also mark tables as <em>restricted</em>, which limits users to those
with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/access-control/role-based-authorization">UnrestrictedViewer
role</a>.
In ADX, a Viewer role can view any table in a database except those
marked as restricted. The UnrestrictedViewer role can view any table in
a database regardless of whether it is restricted or not. The ADX team
is also working on enabling table-level access control, which will allow
even more granular RBAC assignments.</p>

<p>We are also leveraging ADX retention policies to ensure data doesn&#39;t
stick around forever. In some cases, this is a requirement of the
Microsoft data handling standards that are mandatory across the company.
In other cases, we ensure prototypes and proofs-of-concept are cleaned
up so they don&#39;t make their way into our production boundary. I
detailed this in my <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2020/02/01/self-serve-analytics.html">previous
post</a>,
where I discussed how we move analytics from the prototype Scratch
database (with its 30-day retention policy) to WorkArea and then to
Production.</p>

<h2>Scaling Out</h2>

<p>As more and more workloads are served by our main ADX cluster, we need
to start thinking about performance and scale. We are addressing this in
two main ways: With our approach to data distribution and by looking
into follow clusters.</p>

<p><img src="scale-out.png" alt="image"></p>

<p><em>Scaling out from a single ADX cluster serving all workloads to multiple
follow clusters supporting different workloads and ADLS for low
frequency, high volume data movement.</em></p>

<p>We used to simply grant access to our data in ADX to teams interested in
consuming it. The problem with this approach is that external teams
might end up running expensive queries against our cluster and disrupt
other operations. This happened frequently in the common scenario of
bulk data movement of the large data sets our team produces. Because of
this, we are no longer granting access to any service principles to ADX.
We allow individuals to come in and explore our data sets but when they
want to start copying it on a regular cadence, we use a different
storage solution: <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/data-lake-storage/">Azure Data Lake
Storage</a>
(ADLS).</p>

<p>Because our data sets are updated on a daily, weekly, or monthly
cadence, we only need to copy them to ADLS once after an update, and
then other teams can pick them up from there without having an impact on
the performance of our ADX cluster. ADLS provides large scale storage at
very low cost, so it is ideal for this scenario.</p>

<p>The other scaling method we are considering is setting up <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/management/cluster-follower">follow
clusters</a>.
A follower cluster can replicate data from the followed cluster, which
would enable us to offload some workloads to separate compute. By
default, everything is followed, which is redundant for the amount of
data we have, but a follower can be configured to mirror only a subset
of the followed data. We can do this by starting with a caching policy
of 0 (which prevents any data replication), and then selectively
overwrite it for the databases and tables we want to replicate.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this post, I&#39;ve discussed our team&#39;s use of Azure Data Explorer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Many of our scenarios involve data exploration. That activity,
combined with the large data ingestion and cross-cluster
capabilities of ADX, makes ADX a great data store solution.</li>
<li>We bring data into our cluster via a clearly defined process so that
data loads can be consistently performed and monitored.</li>
<li>We use DevOps to deploy objects to production from git.</li>
<li>We enhance our raw data with a Customer Model, a curated data set
consisting of three major pieces: A keyring, a set of customer
properties, and an activity model. We use ADX functions as an
interface to this data set.</li>
<li>For compliance, we place data in different databases depending on
its classification, and we have granular access control for each
database.</li>
<li>Scaling out, we offload large copy jobs to Azure Data Lake Storage,
and we can create follow clusters to partition the compute load.</li>
</ul>
