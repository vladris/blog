<h1>Machine Learning at Scale</h1>

<p>This is a cross-post of the article I wrote for Data Science @
Microsoft, <a href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/running-machine-learning-at-scale-808b90f0ec75">Running machine learning at
scale</a>.</p>

<p>Our team runs dozens of production machine learning models on a daily,
weekly, and monthly basis. We recently went through a redesign of our ML
infrastructure to increase its abilities to enable self-serve, scale to
match computing needs, reduce impacts among models running on the same
VM, and remove differences between dev and production environments. In
this post, I will describe the challenges we faced with the previous
infrastructure and how we addressed them with our Version 2
architecture.</p>

<h2>Version 1</h2>

<p>Our machine learning engineers use Python and R to implement models. Our
Version 1 infrastructure used a custom XML format from which we
generated Azure Data Factory (ADF) v1 pipelines to copy the model input
data to blob storage. Then the models ran on a set of VMs our team
maintained. The models read their input from and wrote their output back
to blob storage. The ADF pipelines then copied the outputs to <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2020/03/01/azure-data-explorer.html">Azure
Data
Explorer</a>
and to our data distribution Data Lake.</p>

<p><img src="v1.png" alt="image"></p>

<p><em>The Control VM consumes XML from Git and generates ADF pipelines to
orchestrate data movement and run ML code on a set of VMs.</em></p>

<p>The V1 infrastructure had several challenges we set out to overcome:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>No self-serve</strong>: Much like how we <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2020/02/01/self-serve-analytics.html">implemented a self-serve
environment for
analytics</a>,
we wanted to do something similar for machine learning, so our ML
engineers can create and deploy models without needing help from the
data engineering team.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-scaling</strong>: We have some compute-intensive models that run on
a certain day of the month when upstream datasets become available.
For a few days, we need large compute. Then, until the next month,
our compute needs decrease significantly. The V1 infrastructure
didn&#39;t account for this and we had a constant number of VMs running
at all times.</li>
<li><strong>Isolation</strong>: We used to pack multiple models on the same VM, so if
one of them consumed, for example, too much RAM, it would impact all
the other models running on the same VM. We needed better isolation.</li>
<li><strong>Differences between dev and prod environments</strong>: One issue we kept
hitting involved models that ran fine on the ML engineer&#39;s VM but
failed when moving to production because of environment differences
such as missing packages.</li>
</ul>

<p>The combination of these issues created significant operational costs
for the data engineering team: VM management, scaling issues, and having
to re-run models that failed because of either resource constraints or
bugs caused by missing packages in the production environment. As our
machine learning engineers develop more and more models, we decided to
invest in making our infrastructure more robust, scalable, and
self-serve.</p>

<h2>Version 2</h2>

<p>Our Version 2 infrastructure aims to address all these issues and
provide a scalable, self-serve platform for machine learning. Built
fully on Azure, it is made up of the following components, which we&#39;ll
discuss in turn:</p>

<ul>
<li>Orchestration.</li>
<li>Storage and distribution.</li>
<li>Compute.</li>
<li>DevOps.</li>
<li>Monitoring and alerting.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="v2.png" alt="image"></p>

<p><em>ADF pipelines deployed from Git orchestrate data movement and running
ML code, also deployed from Git, on Azure Machine Learning. Data is
distributed through ADLS. The system is monitored using Azure Monitor.</em></p>

<h3>Orchestration</h3>

<p>For orchestration, we use Azure Data Factory V2. In contrast to our V1
infrastructure, we don&#39;t use XML to generate pipelines, rather we
provide a set of
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/solution-templates-introduction">templates</a>
that ML engineers can use to author the pipelines themselves. We have a
dev ADF and a production one.</p>

<p>In general, an end-to-end machine learning pipeline has three steps:
Move inputs, kick off compute, and move outputs. Templates make it easy
to create and configure a pipeline.</p>

<p>We use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/continuous-integration-deployment">CI/CD for
ADF</a>:
The dev ADF instance is synced with Git, and so an ML engineer can
submit a pull request for review. Once approved and merged to master,
ADF generates the ARM template we use to deploy the production ADF
instance.</p>

<p>The two data factories are similar, except that they are connecting to
different environments: Dev to the development storage and compute, and
production to the production storage and compute, which is locked down.
This addresses one of the limitations of our V1, as we now have similar
dev and production environments and so graduating a model from dev to
production is much more seamless.</p>

<h3>Storage and distribution</h3>

<p>For storage, we switched from blob to Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)
gen2. ADLS gen2 is backed by blob storage, with a couple of important
additional features: A hierarchical file system and granular access
control. Both are key to our infrastructure.</p>

<p>The hierarchical file system allows us to create a common folder
structure for our models, with separate folders for inputs and outputs
for each run. The granular access control allows us to enforce who gets
to see what data. This is an important aspect of our platform, since
some models are trained on sensitive information such as Microsoft
revenue that not everyone can view.</p>

<p>Because we are already distributing data through ADLS, we can skip a
copy step: Instead of moving the model output to our data distribution
Data Lake, we can share it in place, applying proper access control. The
less data moves around, the less opportunity for issues in our system
and the less network bandwidth our platform needs to use.</p>

<h3>Compute</h3>

<p>Compute is our biggest upgrade from V1: Instead of maintaining VMs, we
switched to using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/">Azure Machine
Learning</a>
(AML). This is an important switch from IaaS to PaaS, where a lot of the
infrastructure we spent time maintaining is now provisioned and handled
by AML.</p>

<p>AML addresses two of the main problems we set out to solve: Auto-scaling
and isolation for our models. We can run each model on dedicated compute
and then AML <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-set-up-training-targets#run-based-creation">takes care of spinning up the resources required for a
run</a>,
winding them down once the run is over.</p>

<p>Because the configuration for compute is done via code, the dev and
production environments are identical, meaning we don&#39;t run into any
issues when graduating a model to production. We can also select the
size of compute we want via this configuration, and so a model that is
more resource intensive can be configured to run with more RAM and/or
more CPU power. AML also gives us statistics on CPU and memory usage,
which helps us right-size compute for each model.</p>

<h3>DevOps</h3>

<p>Both ADF and AML are synced with Git and deployed via two Azure DevOps
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/?view=azure-devops">release
pipelines</a>.
One of them updates the production ADF instance, the other updates the
AML production instance. We split the two because updating model code
doesn&#39;t require any updates to the orchestration. This means, for
example, that for a model bug fix it is enough to deploy to AML without
touching the Data Factory.</p>

<p><img src="devops.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>Having everything in Git enables self-serve, and brings in the required
engineering rigor: Changes are done through pull requests, we have a
code review process, we don&#39;t make manual changes in the production
environment, we have a history of all the changes, and we can rebuild an
environment from scratch if needed.</p>

<h3>Monitoring and alerting</h3>

<p>We are running a production system, and so monitoring and alerting are
key components. For monitoring, we use Azure Monitor/Log Analytics. ADF
orchestrates all our model runs and it <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/monitor-using-azure-monitor">integrates
natively</a>
with Azure Monitor, where we can define alerts for pipeline failures.</p>

<p>For alerting, we use IcM, the Microsoft-wide incident tracking system.
Pipeline failures generate incident tickets, which alert engineering of
live site issues, like all Azure production services. We are also
providing a Power BI dashboard where stakeholders can see the status of
all models.</p>

<p>Monitoring and alerting help us maintain our service-level agreements
and operational excellence.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this article we looked at our Version 2 machine learning
infrastructure, going over its key components:</p>

<ul>
<li>We use Azure Data Factory to orchestrate all data movement and model
runs.</li>
<li>We use Azure Data Lake Storage to store both model inputs and
outputs, which allows us to implement granular access control and
easily distribute the data to teams downstream.</li>
<li>We use Azure Machine Learning for compute, which enables
auto-scaling and isolation for model runs.</li>
<li>We use Azure DevOps to deploy from Git, which enables self-serve and
reproducibility.</li>
<li>We use Azure Monitor for production environment monitoring and
alerting.</li>
</ul>

<p>This cloud-native architecture allows us to reliably run ML at scale
with a self-serve environment for our machine learning team, increasing
their productivity while decreasing the resources we need to spend.</p>
