<h1>Azure Data Engineering</h1>

<p>I am happy to announce that my new book, <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/azure-data-engineering">Azure Data
Engineering</a>,
launched in Manning Early Access Preview (MEAP). While still a work in
progress, the first chapters are available online. As I keep working on
the book and polishing the draft, more chapters will be added, and
existing chapters will be updated. That being said, the preview is now
live.</p>

<p>For the past few years, I had the opportunity to work as the architect
for Azure&#39;s growth team. Ron Sielinski, our director of data science,
describes how our team uses Azure to understand Azure in <a href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/using-azure-to-understand-azure-1c8f5dc60a0a">this great
article</a>
on our <a href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft">Data Science @
Microsoft</a> Medium
publication.</p>

<p>Our engineering team maintains a big data platform, built fully on
Azure, which supports all our team&#39;s workloads. After we launched our
Medium publication, I contributed a bunch of articles describing some of
our infrastructure, challenges, and solutions. I talked about how we use

Explorer</a>,
how we enabled <a href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/how-we-built-self-serve-data-environment-tools-with-azure-3951a698fc9d">self-serve

how we scaled out our <a href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/running-machine-learning-at-scale-808b90f0ec75?source=friends_link&amp;sk=f89feb151de7645a75fad0b84911c9a6">ML

I noticed across the industry, and <a href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/partnering-for-data-quality-dc9123557f8b">data
quality</a>.</p>

<p>There are plenty of resources out there covering statistics, data
science, and machine learning, but comparatively little covering the
engineering aspects of working with big data. This book is what I wish I
had available to read when joining the team, to help navigate this
complex space and lessons I had to learn the hard way.</p>

<h2>The <q>engineering</q> in data engineering</h2>

<p>While many data science projects start as exploratory, once they show
real value, they need to be supported in an ongoing, reliable fashion.
In the software engineering world, this is the equivalent of taking a
research, proof of concept, or hackathon project and graduating it into
a fully production-ready solution. While a hack or a prototype can cut
many shortcuts and focus on <q>the meat of the problem</q> it addresses, a
production-ready system does not cut any corners. This is where the
engineering part of software engineering comes into play: the
engineering rigor to build and run a reliable system. This includes a
plethora of concerns like architecture and design, performance,
security, accessibility, telemetry, debuggability, extensibility and so
on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Data engineering</strong> is the part of data science dealing with the
practical applications of collecting and analyzing data. It aims to
bring engineering rigor to the process of building and supporting
reliable data systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Data engineering is surprisingly similar to software engineering and
frustratingly different. While we can leverage a lot of the learnings
from the software engineering world, as we will see in this book, there
is a unique set of challenges we will have to address. Some of the
common themes are making sure everything is tracked in source control,
automatic deployments, monitoring and alerting. A key difference between
data and code is that code is static: once the bugs are worked out, a
piece of code is expected to consistently work reliably. On the other
hand, data moves continuously into and out of a data platform and it is
very likely for failures to occur due to various external reasons.
Governance is another major topic which is specific to data: access
control, cataloguing, privacy, and regulatory concerns are a big part of
a data platform.</p>

<p>The main theme of the book is bringing some of the lessons learned from
data engineering over the past few decades to the data space, so you can
build a data platform exhibiting the properties of a solid software
solution: scale, reliability, security, and so on.</p>

<h2>Anatomy of a big data platform</h2>

<p>A big data platform ingests data from multiple sources into a storage
layer. Data is consumed from the storage layer to enable various
workloads (data modeling, analytics, machine learning). Data is then
distributed downstream to consumers. All the activity in a data platform
needs to be orchestrated by an orchestration layer. Governance is
extremely important. And, of course, DevOps is the key: deploying
everything from source control.</p>

<p><img src="platform.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>The book is divided in 3 parts, each part looking at a big data platform
through a different lens:</p>

<ul>
<li>Part 1 of the book will focus on <strong>infrastructure</strong>, the core
services of a data platform.

<ul>
<li>We will start with <strong>storage</strong>, the backbone of any data
platform. Chapter 2 will cover the requirements and common
patterns for storing data in a data platform.</li>
<li>Since our focus is on production systems, in chapter 3 we&#39;ll
discuss <strong>DevOps</strong> and what DevOps means for data.</li>
<li>Data is ingested into the system from multiple sources. Data
flows into and out of the platform and various workflows are
executed. All of this needs an orchestration layer to keep
things running. We will talk about <strong>orchestration</strong> in chapter 4.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Part 2 will focus on the 3 main <strong>workloads</strong> that a data platform
must support:

<ul>
<li><strong>Modeling</strong>: this includes aggregating and reshaping the data,
standardizing schema, and any other processing of the raw input
data. This makes the data easier to consume by the other two
main processes: analytics and machine learning. We will talk
about data modeling in chapter 5.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong>: this covers all analysis and reporting on the
data, deriving knowledge and insights. We will look at ways to
support this in production in chapter 6.</li>
<li><strong>Machine learning</strong>: these are all machine learning models
training on the data. We cover running ML at scale in chapter 7.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Part 3, <strong>governance</strong>, is a major topic with many aspects. We will
cover governance in chapters 8, 9, and 10, touching on the key
topics:

<ul>
<li><strong>Metadata</strong>: cataloguing and inventorying the data, tracking
lineage, definitions and documentation is the subject of chapter 8.</li>
<li><strong>Data quality</strong>: how to test data and asses its quality is the
topic of chapter 9.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance</strong>: honoring complying requirements like the General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), handling sensitive data, and
controlling access is covered in chapter 10.</li>
<li>After all the processing steps, data eventually leaves the
platform to be consumed by other systems. We will cover the
various patterns for <strong>distributing data</strong> in chapter 11.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The examples in the book are built on Azure, using a specific set of
technologies, but the patterns should apply regardless of specific tech
choices or even cloud providers. Check out the book
