<h1>10 Years</h1>

<p>This post marks the tenth year of my technical blog. I started in 2016, ended up
writing exactly 9 posts during that year, and made it a point to consistently
stick to that number. You are reading post #90. This will be a self-indulgent
look back at the past decade.</p>

<p>Why 9 posts per year? While sometimes I have plenty of things to write about,
other times I get busy and don’t have the time. Maybe something like a post per
month would’ve been nicer, but harder to achieve. I’m still happy I was able to
stick to this for so long.</p>

<p>I started self-hosting the blog on my own engine, Tinkerer, which is now
archived <a href="https://github.com/vladris/tinkerer">here</a>. Tinkerer relied heavily on
<a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">Sphinx</a> and
<a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/">Jinja</a>, relying on the Sphinx
plugin system to turn it into a blog. Extensions provided post metadata,
ordering and pagination, RSS-feed generation and so on. That worked well until
it didn’t. Updates to Sphinx irrevocably broke things, plus Markdown was gaining
momentum - who even remembers the cumbersome ReStrctured Text syntax? I
implemented Baku, the spiritual successor to Tinkerer, and used PanDoc to
migrate my old posts from RST to Markdown.</p>

<p>Baku, which I’m using to this day, is <a href="https://github.com/vladris/baku">here</a>.
It completely drops the Sphinx dependency and replaces Jinja with a 100 LoC
templating engine which I’m still very proud of - my
<a href="https://github.com/vladris/baku/blob/main/baku/templating.py">VerySimpleTemplate</a>.
Lesson learned: the fewer dependencies the better.</p>

<p>Throughout the years I covered various topics I was digging into at the time.
When I started the blog in 2016, I was working on the Office C++ clients. The
very first two posts are based on a Clean Code talk I used to do (see <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2016/01/04/clean-code-part-1.html">Clean
Code Part - 1</a> and
<a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2016/01/07/clean-code-part-2.html">Clean Code Part -
2</a>).</p>

<p>I was digging deep into modern C++ at the time. Some posts, like <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2016/03/11/arguments-and-smart-pointers.html">Arguments and
Smart
Pointers</a>
and <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2016/10/16/notes-on-types.html">Notes on Types</a>
provide best practices. Others covered some of my own R&amp;D. A version of the
efficient stack-allocated data structure I describe in <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2016/04/24/abusing-maps.html">(Ab)using
Maps</a> made its way into
the Office core libraries and became a standard for applicable scenarios. The
<a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2016/10/09/composable-generators.html">Composable
Generators</a> post
became this small library that enables generator chaining in C++:
<a href="https://github.com/vladris/pipe">https://github.com/vladris/pipe</a>. This was back when generators were still an
experimental language feature.</p>

<p>Around that time, I was starting to dig into types and type systems. I wrote an
initial <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2016/10/16/notes-on-types.html">Notes on
Types</a> post, and a
while later one covering the Idris programming language - <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2017/07/20/idris-totality-dependent-types-proofs.html">Idris: Totality,
Dependent Types,
Proofs</a>.
Then <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2018/01/27/notes-on-oop.html">Notes on OOP</a> and
<a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2018/09/09/clean-code-types.html">Clean Code: Types</a>,
all around the topic of types. This became my first published book, <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/programming-with-types">Programming
with Types</a> in 2019.</p>

<p>Several posts from around that time were topics that I was researching and which
made their way in the book, like <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2018/10/13/arithmetic-overflow-and-underflow.html">Arithmetic Overflow and
Underflow</a>
and <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2018/11/18/notes-on-encoding-text.html">Notes on Encoding
Text</a>, or
excerpts from the book once it was ready:</p>

</ul>

<p>I switched jobs in 2019, going from Office to Azure and trading in C++ for data
platform architecture. My first post on the subject was <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2019/12/08/notes-on-data-engineering.html">Notes on Data
Engineering</a>.
It was a new space for me, with plenty to learn, and during 2020 I wrote a bunch
about it:</p>

<ul>

and <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2021/09/24/machine-learning-on-azure-part-3.html">Part
3</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Like the previous type rabbit hole, I ended up publishing <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/data-engineering-on-azure">Data Engineering on
Azure</a> in 2021.</p>

<p>At the same time, I switched teams again, moving from Azure back to Office to
work on <a href="https://fluidframework.com/">Fluid Framework</a> and then
<a href="https://aka.ms/loop/">Loop</a>. I wrote the first <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2021/12/11/mental-poker.html">Mental
Poker</a> post in December
2021, while thinking through how one could implement a game over Fluid
Framework. This became an on-and-off side project which resulted into the Mental
Poker series of posts:</p>

</ul>

<p>I wrote these over the span of two years, from early 2023 to late 2024, while
creating this open source library:
<a href="https://github.com/vladris/mental-poker-toolkit">https://github.com/vladris/mental-poker-toolkit</a>.</p>

<p>Before Mental Poker, I spent 2022 digging into computability. I always found the subject fascinating:</p>

<li><a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2022/12/01/computability-part-9-lisp.html">Computability Part 9: LISP</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After wrapping up the Mental Poker toolkit, I spent 2025 implementing a text
editor and wrote several DevLog posts about it -
<a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2025/03/08/devlog-1-flow.html">Flow</a>,
<a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2025/04/04/devlog-2-formatting.html">Formatting</a>,
<a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2025/05/08/devlog-3-commanding.html">Commanding</a>,
<a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2025/08/03/devlog-4-theming-and-footguns.html">Theming and
Footguns</a>,
<a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2025/09/08/devlog-5-markdown-and-wysiwyg.html">Markdown and
WYSIWYG</a>.</p>

<p>Sometime in 2023, when GPT3 took the world by storm, I wrote another book,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLSSM8RL">Large Language Models at Work</a>. I didn’t
publish excerpts on my blog as I made it freely available at
<a href="https://vladris.com/llm-book">https://vladris.com/llm-book</a>. Fun fact, the book website is also built using
Baku, just like this blog.</p>

<p>The industry moved fast, and what was state of the art in 2023 became mostly
obsolete by 2025. I reflect on that in <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2025/09/29/agent-integration-patterns.html">Agent Integration
Patterns</a>.</p>

<p>With the holiday season coming, I’m excited about <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of
Code</a>. I’ve been solving puzzles since its inception
and since 2023, I made it a tradition to start the year with a post covering the
past December’s Advent of Code, focusing on the problems I found most
interesting.</p>

<p>Not everything requires series of posts, sometimes I write a self-contained
just-for-fun thing. Like how I implemented a <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2025/06/08/digital-horology.html">digital pendulum
clock</a>, a solver for
an iPhone game called <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2018/04/15/kami-2.html">Kami 2</a>,
or a solver for the game <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2017/08/13/24.html">24</a>. Or
that time I implemented
<a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2021/12/30/timsort.html">Timsort</a> to get a better
sense of how it works.</p>

<p>The above is not a complete list of what I wrote here over the past 10 years,
rather a recap of some of the major themes. It’s been a fun ride so far. As for
the next 10 years - who knows? I know my next post will cover Advent of Code
2025. The sky is the limit beyond that.</p>

<p>I have plenty of things I still want to cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>More on Flow - Turns out you learn a lot when you implement a text editor.
Also on Flow’s successor. Electron is too much of a hog so I started
experimenting with an editor based on Tauri, geared towards long-form writing.</li>
<li>More on AI - We’re still evolving the ways we integrate AI into software and
there’s plenty of learning to cover there.</li>
<li>Webdev - For the past 5 years or so, my day job had me using TypeScript,
React, and the wonderful JS ecosystem. I have many thoughts here.</li>
<li>Building product - I scratched the surface of this with <a href="https://vladris.com/blog/2021/08/12/shipping-a-feature.html">Shipping a
Feature</a>. There’s
a lot more to cover. I learned a lot shipping software to millions of users
while working on Office.</li>
<li>Other areas of interest, like programming languages, compilers and runtimes,
pragmatic functional programming etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Happy holidays and see you in 2026! Thank you for reading!</p>
